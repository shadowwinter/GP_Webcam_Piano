Using p5.js to create a simple HTML Webcam Piano clone

To start, run the index.html file. 

Allow webcam access and turn on your volume!

Move around in the frame and watch and listen as your webcam becomes a live piano. 
Options to toggle to guitar, change the sensitivity level, and to show the notes that are being played is available as well.
